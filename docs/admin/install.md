# Installing the App in Nautobot

Here you will find detailed instructions on how to **install** and **configure** the App within your Nautobot environment.


## Prerequisites

- The app is compatible with Nautobot 1.5.4 and higher.
- Databases supported: PostgreSQL, MySQL

!!! note
    Please check the [dedicated page](compatibility_matrix.md) for a full compatibility matrix and the deprecation policy.


## Install Guide

!!! note
    Apps can be installed manually or using Python's `pip`. See the [nautobot documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/plugins/#install-the-package) for more details. The pip package name for this app is [`nautobot-bgp-models`](https://pypi.org/project/nautobot-bgp-models/).

The app is available as a Python package via PyPI and can be installed with `pip`:

```shell
pip install nautobot-bgp-models
```

To ensure BGP Models is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the Nautobot root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `nautobot-bgp-models` package:

```shell
echo nautobot-bgp-models >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the app needs to be enabled in your Nautobot configuration. The following block of code below shows the additional configuration required to be added to your `nautobot_config.py` file:

- Append `"nautobot_bgp_models"` to the `PLUGINS` list.
- Append the `"nautobot_bgp_models"` dictionary to the `PLUGINS_CONFIG` dictionary and override any defaults.

```python
# In your nautobot_config.py
PLUGINS = ["nautobot_bgp_models"]

# PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
#   "nautobot_bgp_models": {
#     ADD YOUR SETTINGS HERE
#   }
# }
```

Once the Nautobot configuration is updated, run the Post Upgrade command (`nautobot-server post_upgrade`) to run migrations and clear any cache:

```shell
nautobot-server post_upgrade
```

Then restart (if necessary) the Nautobot services which may include:

- Nautobot
- Nautobot Workers
- Nautobot Scheduler

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nautobot nautobot-worker nautobot-scheduler
```

## App Configuration

An example configuration is provided below:

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "nautobot_bgp_models": {
        "default_statuses": {
            "AutonomousSystem": ["Active", "Available", "Planned"],
            "Peering": ["Active", "Decommissioned", "Deprovisioning", "Offline", "Planned", "Provisioning"],
        }
    }
}
```

In the `default_statuses` section, you can define a list of default statuses to make available to `AutonomousSystem` and/or `Peering`. The lists must be composed of valid slugs of existing Status objects.
